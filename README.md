###Bandwagon++

A simple full stack web app that allows a user to search for songs through Spotify's API.
When the user searches for a song a list of cards are returned containing
information about the artist.

Using HTMl 5 canvas and audio tags, the song is transformed into an array of
8 bit integers that are fed into a canvas that renders a visual representation
of the data.

##Technologies used:

- HTML5/CSS (Google's Materialize Framework)
  - HTML5 Canvas/Audio tags to render audio visualizations
- Javascript and Facebook's React (or is it a framework??); Facebook/React boilerplate used
(apparently makes deployment to heroku easier)
- Node/Express.js
- Postgresql
